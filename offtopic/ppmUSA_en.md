***CONFIDENTIAL MASTER OFFERING MEMORANDUM***

**REENTAL MASTER, LLC**

**Offering of Interests Deliverable in the Form of Cryptographic Digital Tokens**

This memorandum describes the offering of fractional digital RNT tokens (the “Tokens” or “Interests”), which run natively on the blockchain of the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network following the ERC-20 standard, to be offered by Reental Master, LLC (“Reental Master”), a Florida limited liability company, through a series of affiliate limited liability companies (the “Affiliates). Such Tokens shall be used for purchasing Portfolio Investments, as defined herein, through the Affiliates. For the purposes of clarity only, Reental Master is merely a qualifying company that manages the web platform (<http://reental.co>) through which future offerings will be made to qualified subscribed users for the ability to purchase Tokens as an interest in said Affiliates that own or will own real estate investment properties.  Thus, this memorandum shall only be considered a master offering memorandum, describing the procedure for which offerings become available, the participation of investors or Token holders in Affiliates as they become available, and the role of the participating companies in the management of the business; as well as the traditional risk factors disclosed in private placement memorandums.

Reental Master reserves the right to admit investors or make available Portfolio Investments through Affiliates to certain investors.  At the time of this memorandum, Reental Master and its Affiliates are only offering investment opportunities outside of the United States to foreign persons (as defined under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) section 7701(b)(1)(A)) pursuant to Regulation S, adopted by the Security Exchange Commission (SEC); and in the United States to U.S. persons (as defined in [Section](https://www.lawinsider.com/clause/foreign-investors) 7701(a)(30) of the Code) that qualify as \"accredited investor,\" as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The Affiliates have been formed or shall be formed for the purpose of generating capital appreciation and current income through investments in income producing real estate properties located in the United States (the “Portfolio Investments”) to be selected by the Manager. The manager of the Affiliates is or shall be Reental America, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (the “Manager”).

Once the Manager identifies a Portfolio Investment, it may prepare an offering with specific terms related to the identified Portfolio Investment and publish it to subscribed users on Rental Master’s web platform for investment opportunities in the Affiliates through the purchase of Tokens. Each offering will have individual terms which shall be disclosed by the respective Affiliate on its own sub offering memorandum, subscription agreement and operating agreement.

**An Investment in Tokens is subject to significant risks. “See “Risk Factors.”**

The initial closing of the Token offerings (the “Initial Closing”), through the Affiliates, shall be contingent upon each respective Affiliate’s receipt and acceptance of subscriptions for the minimum amount stated in each offering in Capital Contributions (“Capital Contributions”) from subscribers of the Tokens.  In the event that this condition is not fulfilled within (90) days of the Effective Date of the Affiliate Subscription Agreement (the \"Commitment Period\"), then the respective offering will be cancelled, and all subscribers will be released from their obligations to the Affiliate and all funds provided by the subscribers will be returned to them without interest or deduction, less any processing fees incurred in the transfer of the Tokens.  If this condition is fulfilled, then the Manager will confirm the closing of the Initial Closing and admission of the subscribers as Members of the respective Affiliate.  After the Initial Closing, the Manager may, at its option, continue to offer Tokens until the aggregate amount of Capital Contributions reaches the total offering described.

The minimum Capital Contribution for each subscriber wishing to participate in a subscription of a total investment amount shall be no less than the Token price set forth in each offering, with any additional Capital Contribution to be made in increments of the price per Token stated in each respective offering, subject to lesser amounts being accepted at the discretion of the Manager. The Manager may, in its discretion, increase or decrease the minimum or maximum at any time. See “Terms of Offering.”

Each subscriber is required to remit to the Manager an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the subscriber’s Capital Contribution upon the execution of the subscription agreement and “checkout” process.  The Manager shall have sole discretion in acceptance of an investor’s subscription.  The Manager will hold this amount until the earlier of the Initial Closing or the cancellation of a particular offering, or non-acceptance of the subscription. In the event that the offering is cancelled, or an investor’s subscription is not accepted, the Manager will promptly return the amount remitted by the subscriber, without interest or deduction, except for any processing costs associated with the exchange of the Token.  See “Terms of Offering.”

The Manager reserves the right to accept or reject any subscription to purchase the Tokens in its discretion and having ownership interest in other funds, Affiliates or investment vehicles managed by Manager does not guarantee acceptance of an investor into a particular offering. The Manager intends to offer the Tokens on behalf of the Affiliates. The Manager and its Affiliates will not receive any compensation in connection with the sale of the Tokens.

**The RNT Tokens will be “restricted securities” for purposes of the Securities Act. As a result, the RNT Tokens may not be resold or otherwise transferred except in a transaction that is either registered under the Securities Act or exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The RNT Tokens will also be subject to restrictions on transfer set forth in the Subscription Agreement and Reental Master’s web platform. As a prospective purchaser, you should be aware that you may be required to bear the financial risks of an investment in the RNT Tokens for an indefinite period of time. For a description of certain restrictions on transfers of the RNT Tokens, see “Risk Factors” and “Transfer Restrictions.”**

**An investment in the RNT Tokens is highly speculative and involves substantial risks. An investment in the RNT Tokens is not suitable for any investor who is not able to understand the nature of the risks of an investment in the RNT Tokens or who is unable to bear the loss of their entire investment in the RNT Tokens. See \"Risk Factors\"**

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This memorandum contains forward-looking statements.  You should not place undue reliance on these statements.  Forward-looking statements include information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations, goals and objectives for future operations, including descriptions of the Affiliates’ investment strategies, among other things.  These statements are typically identified by words such as “believe”, “anticipate”, “expect”, “plan”, “intend”, “estimate” and similar expressions. The Manager based these statements on particular assumptions made by the Manager, as well as its perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that the Manager believes are appropriate under the circumstances.  As you read and consider the information in this memorandum, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results.  They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions.

Although we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect the Affiliates’ actual financial results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.  These factors include, among other things:

- the Manager’s ability to identify attractive Portfolio Investments;

- the Affiliates’ ability to complete the acquisitions of Portfolio Investments;

- the Affiliates’ ability to obtain financing for purchase of Portfolio Investments;

- the Manager’s ability to manage and operate Portfolio Investments successfully;

- the Manager’s ability to sell Portfolio Investments at attractive prices;

- the impact of natural disasters such hurricanes, floods and tornados;

- the demand for real estate in the markets in which the Affiliates acquire Portfolio Investments; and

- general economic conditions.

In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the results and events contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this memorandum will in fact transpire.

THE MEMORANDUM SUMMARY PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY THE MORE DETAILED INFORMATION INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS MEMORANDUM, AS WELL AS THE VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONAL DOCUMENTS AND AGREEMENTS DESCRIBED IN OR AVAILABLE PURSUANT TO THIS MEMORANDUM. THIS SECTION WHICH IS BEING PROVIDED ON A CONFIDENTIAL BASIS SHALL NOT CONSTITUTE AN OFFER TO SELL OR THE SOLICITATION OF ANY OFFER TO BUY WHICH MAY BE MADE ONLY AT THE TIME A QUALIFIED OFFEREE RECEIVES THE COMPLETE MEMORANDUM, WHICH CONTAINS IMPORTANT INFORMATION (INCLUDING EXPENSES AND RISK FACTORS) AND ONLY IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS WHERE PERMITTED BY LAW. IN THE CASE OF ANY INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE DESCRIPTIONS OR TERMS IN THIS SECTION AND THE MEMORANDUM, THE MEMORANDUM SHALL CONTROL. THESE SECURITIES SHALL NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD IN ANY JURISDICTION IN WHICH SUCH OFFER, SOLICITATION OR SALE WOULD BE UNLAWFUL UNTIL THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAWS OF SUCH JURISDICTION HAVE BEEN SATISFIED. THIS SECTION IS NOT INTENDED FOR PUBLIC USE OR DISTRIBUTION.

AN INVESTMENT IN AN AFFILIATE IS SPECULATIVE AND INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. WITHDRAWAL IS NOT PERMITTED AND TRANSFERABILITY OF THE INTERESTS IS RESTRICTED, SO INVESTORS MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL WHEN IT IS NEEDED. THERE IS NO SECONDARY MARKET FOR THE INTERESTS AND NONE IS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP. THE PORTFOLIO WHICH IS UNDER THE SOLE INVESTMENT AUTHORITY OF THE COMPANY OR MANAGER IS PRIMARILY CONCENTRATED IN CERTAIN REAL ESTATE AND TECHNOLOGY-RELATED ASSETS AND THE LACK OF DIVERSIFICATION MAY RESULT IN HIGHER RISK. LEVERAGE MAY BE EMPLOYED IN THE PORTFOLIO, WHICH CAN MAKE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE VOLATILE. AN INVESTOR SHOULD NOT MAKE AN INVESTMENT UNLESS IT IS PREPARED TO LOSE ALL OR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF ITS INVESTMENT. THE FEES AND EXPENSES CHARGED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS INVESTMENT MAY BE HIGHER THAN THE FEES AND EXPENSES OF OTHER INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES AND MAY OFFSET PROFITS.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE AFFILIATES WILL ACHIEVE THEIR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE OR AVOID SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES, INCLUDING A TOTAL LOSS OF INVESTMENT.

## **RISK FACTORS**

*You should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision.  These risks could cause you to lose all or part of your investment. The risks described below are not the only ones facing the Affiliates. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial might also impair our results of operations.*

**Risks Related to the Affiliate’s Business**

***Because this is a blind pool offering, investors will not have the opportunity to evaluate the Affiliates’ investment.***

The Affiliates expects to invest the net offering proceeds in the acquisition of the Portfolio Investments which meet the Manager’s investment criteria.  Reental Master has not yet identified any investment that may be made by the Affiliates in the future.  As a result, Reental Master will be unable to provide investors with information to evaluate the Portfolio Investments as all Portfolio Investments are purchased by the Affiliates after the Initial Closing.

***Each Affiliate will make a single investment.***

***The respective Affiliates will make only one investment. As a result, the Affiliates’ investments will not be diversified. An investment in the Tokens will be subject to greater risk to the extent that the Affiliates lack a diversified portfolio of investments.***

***The Affiliates operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities with competitors who may have greater resources.  This may cause the Affiliates to lose investment opportunities or to invest on less favorable terms.***

The Affiliates will compete with a large number of other investors for attractive real estate investment opportunities.  These competitors include public and private Memberships, real estate investment trusts and private investors.  Many of these competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than the Affiliates.  Additionally, many competitors may have a lower cost of capital and access to financing sources that are not available to the Affiliates or the Manager.  As a result of this competition, the Affiliates may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities, and the Affiliates may not be able to identify and make an investment that is consistent with its investment objectives.

**Risks Related to Management**

***The Affiliate’s future success is dependent upon the principals of the Manager and the loss of any of them could severely and detrimentally affect the Affiliates’ operations.***

The Affiliates will depend on the diligence, experience, skill, and network of business contacts of the Manager and its principals, including their access to information and investment opportunities arising from their other activities.  The principals will evaluate, negotiate, structure, close and monitor the Affiliates’ investments.  The Affiliates’ future success will depend on the continued services of the management team of the Manager.  The departure of any of the principals could have a material adverse effect on the Affiliates’ ability to achieve its investment objectives.

***The Manager and its principals may engage in other investment activities, which could reduce the amount of time and effort that they devote to the Affiliates.***

The Operating Agreement does not restrict the right of the Manager or the principals of the Manager to carry on other business activities, including other real estate investment activities.  In addition, the Operating Agreement does not specify a minimum time period that the principals of the Manager must devote to managing the Affiliates’ investments. The principals will have responsibilities in connection with their roles as principals and officers of other entities.  The ability of these parties to engage in these other business activities could reduce the time and effort they spend managing the Affiliates’ investments, which could negatively impact the Affiliates’ performance.

***The principals of the Manager are currently engaged in other real estate investment related activities and expect to engage in additional investment activities in the future.  As a result, they may face conflicts of interest in allocating real estate investments.***

The principals of the Manager are currently engaged in a variety of real estate investment activities for their own account and for the account of third parties and they expect to continue to engage in such activities in the future.  As a result of these activities, the Principals’ team will be subject to conflicts of interest in determining whether to allocate real estate investment opportunities to the Affiliates.

The principals of the Manager are not prohibited from engaging in other business ventures and activities, including real estate investments, which are competitive with those of the Affiliates.  Furthermore, each Member will be required to agree that any such activities are not deemed to be a breach of the Operating Agreement, or any duty owed by any such person to the Affiliates.

***The liability of the Manager and its principals will be limited under the Operating Agreement, and the Affiliate will agree to indemnify the Manager and its principals against certain liabilities, which may lead them to act in a riskier manner on behalf of the Affiliate than it would when acting for their own account.***

Pursuant to the Operating Agreement, the Manager and its principals will not be liable to the Affiliate and/or the Reental Master for their acts, unless they constitute bad faith, gross negligence or intentional misconduct, or a breach of the Operating Agreement or knowing violation of law.  The Affiliate has agreed to indemnify, defend, and protect the Manager and its principals with respect to all damages, liabilities, costs and expenses resulting from acts of the Manager and its principals not arising out of bad faith, gross negligence or intentional misconduct, or breach of the Operating Agreement and knowing violation of law.  These protections may lead the Manager and its principals to act in a riskier manner when acting on behalf of the Affiliate than it would when acting for their own account.

**Risks Related to the Offering**

***The Affiliate may allocate your Capital Contributions to investments with which you may not agree.***

The Manager has complete discretion in investing Capital Contributions and may use your Capital Contributions to purchase Portfolio Investments with which you may not agree. You will have no opportunity to select or evaluate the Portfolio Investments.

***The  Affiliate’s ability to acquire the Portfolio Investments depends on the ability of its Members to fulfill their Capital Contributions.  In the event that any Member fails to make a required Capital Contribution, the Affiliate’s ability to acquire Portfolio Investments could be adversely affected and the Manager and/or Affiliate could be exposed to claims from other parties due to the Affiliate’s failure to make proposed investments.***

Each Member will be required to make Capital Contributions in proportion to its Interest in the Affiliate. The Manager will have the right to request a Drawdown of these Capital Contributions in connection with the acquisition of a Portfolio Investment. In the event that any Member fails to make a required Capital Contribution, the Affiliate’s ability to consummate an acquisition could be adversely affected.  Furthermore, such failure may subject the Affiliate and/or the Manager to breach of contract claims from third parties.

***In the event that a Member fails to make a Capital Contribution when required, the Affiliate and/or Manager may take a variety of actions against the Member, including forfeiture of its Tokens.***

The failure of a Member to make a required Capital Contribution is an Event of Default under the Operating Agreement.  Upon the occurrence of such an Event of Default, the Manager may, in its discretion, impose one or more of the following consequences on the Defaulting Member:

- the Manager may elect, in its sole discretion, to charge the Defaulting Member interest on any overdue amounts;
- the Manager may, in its sole discretion, cancel the right of the Defaulting Member to exercise voting rights, subject to the limitations set forth in the Operating Agreement;
- the Manager may, in its sole discretion, require the Defaulting Member to sell its Interest in the Affiliate on terms which the Manager believes, in good faith, to be commercially reasonable;
- the Manager, in its sole discretion, may elect to commence legal proceedings against the Defaulting Member to collect amounts owed by the Member; and
- the Manager, in its sole discretion, may elect to cause the Defaulting Member to forfeit all of its Interest in the Affiliate.

***An investor’s ability to transfer the Tokens.***

Generally, Members may sell or transfer their Tokens through the Manager’s platform or third-party blockchain markets; however, non-U.S. persons that acquire Tokens outside of the United States may be limited in selling or transferring their Tokens to U.S. persons for a period of at least one (1) year.  No Member may assign or encumber any part of their Tokens without the prior written consent of the Manager.  In addition, any Member who wishes to transfer or sell its Tokens must also meet certain conditions set forth in the Operating Agreement.  As a result, an investor’s ability to transfer his, her or its Tokens may be subject to limitations.

***An investor’s ability to transfer its Tokens is restricted under federal and state securities laws.***

The Affiliate has offered the Tokens in reliance upon an exemption from registration under the Securities Act for an offer and sale of securities that does not involve a public offering.  The Tokens have not been registered under the Securities Act or under any state securities laws and may not be resold except pursuant to an exemption from or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.  Each investor should be aware that it may be required to bear the financial risk of an investment in the Tokens for an indefinite period of time.

***An investment in the Affiliate is subject to certain tax risks***.

The income tax aspects of an investment in the Affiliate are complicated, and each investor should have such tax aspects reviewed by professional advisors familiar with the investor’s personal tax situation and with the tax laws and regulations applicable to the investor and an investment in a limited liability company such as the Affiliate’s.  The Affiliate is not intended and should not be expected to provide any tax shelter.

Each Member’s investment in the Affiliate is subject to certain income tax risks, some of which are summarized under “Federal Income Tax Considerations,” including but not necessarily limited to, the following:

- IRS classification of the Affiliate as an association taxable as a limited liability company for federal tax purposes;

- Characterization of the income of the Affiliate as ordinary income resulting in allocation of ordinary income to the Members instead of capital gains;

- Allocation of taxable income to a Member without cash distributions to such Member, and/or IRS challenges to the allocation provisions used by the Affiliate;

- Limitations on the ability of a Member to deduct the Affiliate’s passive losses and/or certain other expenses of the Affiliate allocated to such Member;

- Changes in the wording, interpretation, or application of current tax laws, regulations, and rules, affecting the Affiliate and/or the Members; and

- IRS or state audit of the Affiliate’s information returns which could result in a corresponding adjustment affecting the Members and their tax liability including interest and penalties.

There can be no assurance that the tax consequences described in the offering memorandum will be applied to the Affiliate or the Members. In this connection, this memorandum does not describe the income tax consequences for non-U.S. investors.  Furthermore, tax consequences are subject to change by legislation, administrative action and judicial decision.  Legislation has been proposed from time to time in Congress which, if enacted, could modify the tax treatment of the Affiliate, the Reental Master, or the Members.  If the IRS challenges any tax position taken by the Affiliate, and such challenge is sustained, Members may incur liability for interest and penalties.

A Member may incur tax liabilities under state or local income tax laws of certain jurisdictions in which the Affiliate operates as well as the jurisdiction of such Member’s residence or domicile, which laws vary from one locale to another and which, like federal income tax laws, are complex and subject to change.

**General Risks Related to Investments in Real Estate**

***The Affiliate’s operating results will be affected by economic and regulatory changes that have an adverse impact on the real estate market in general, and neither the Affiliate nor Manager can assure investors that it will be profitable or that it will realize growth in the value of its real estate properties.***

The Affiliate’s operating results will be subject to risks generally incident to the ownership of real estate, including:

- changes in general economic or local conditions;
- changes in supply of or demand for similar or competing properties in an area;
- changes in interest rates and availability of permanent mortgage financing which may render the sale of a property difficult or unattractive;
- changes in tax, real estate, environmental and zoning laws; and
- periods of high interest rates and tight money supply.

For these and other reasons, neither the Affiliate nor the Manager can assure investors that it will be profitable or that it will realize growth in the value of its real estate investment.

***The Affiliate will depend on tenants for revenues, and lease terminations could reduce distributions to Members.***

The success of the Affiliate’s investments depends in large part upon the financial stability of the tenants at the property to be acquired by the Affiliate.  Lease payment defaults by tenants could cause the Affiliate to reduce the amount of distributions to Members. A default by a significant tenant on its lease payments would cause the Affiliate to lose the revenue associated with such lease and force the Affiliate to find an alternative source of revenue to meet mortgage payments and prevent a foreclosure if the property is subject to a mortgage.  In the event of a tenant default or bankruptcy, the Affiliate may experience delays in enforcing its rights as landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting its investment and re-letting the Affiliate’s property.  If significant leases are terminated, the Affiliate may not be able to lease the property for the rent previously received or sell the property without incurring a loss.

***The Affiliate may be unable to lease or sell a Portfolio Investment if or when it decides to do so.***

The real estate market is affected by many factors, such as general economic conditions, availability of financing, interest rates and other factors, including supply and demand, that are beyond the Affiliate’s control.  The Affiliate cannot predict whether it will be able to lease or sell any Portfolio Investment for the price or on the terms set by the Affiliate, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to the Affiliate.  The Affiliate cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of any Portfolio Investment.  If the Affiliate is unable to sell the Portfolio Investment when the Affiliate and/or Manager determines to do so, it could have a significant adverse effect on the Affiliate’s cash flow and results of operations.

***Uninsured losses relating to the Portfolio Investments or excessively expensive premiums for insurance coverage may adversely affect the Affiliate.***

The Affiliate and Manager will attempt to obtain adequate insurance on the Portfolio Investments to cover casualty losses.  However, there are types of losses, generally catastrophic in nature, such as losses due to wars, acts of terrorism, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, pollution, or environmental matters, which are uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may be insured subject to limitations, such as large deductibles or co-payments. Insurance risks associated with potential terrorist acts could sharply increase the premiums the Affiliate pays for coverage against property and casualty claims. Additionally, mortgage lenders in some cases have begun to insist that specific coverage against terrorism be purchased by commercial property owners as a condition for providing mortgage loans.  It is uncertain whether such insurance policies will be available, or available at reasonable cost, which could inhibit the Affiliate’s ability to finance or refinance its property.  In such instances, the Affiliate may be required to provide other financial support, either through financial assurances or self-insurance, to cover potential losses. The Affiliate cannot assure investors that it will have adequate coverage for such losses.  In the event that any Portfolio Investment incurs a casualty loss that is not fully covered by insurance, the value of its assets will be reduced by any such uninsured loss.  In addition, other than the working capital reserve or other reserves the Affiliate may establish, the Affiliate has no source of financing to repair or reconstruct any uninsured damaged property, and the Affiliate cannot assure investors that any such sources of financing will be available for such purposes in the future.  Also, to the extent the Affiliate must pay unexpectedly large amounts for insurance, the Affiliate could suffer reduced income that would result in reduced distributions to Members.

***Uncertain market conditions relating to the future disposition of the Portfolio Investments could adversely affect the Affiliate’s return on its investments.***

The Affiliate intends to hold the Portfolio Investments until such time as the Manager determines that a sale, lease, or other disposition appears to be advantageous to achieve the Affiliate’s investment objectives or until it appears that such objectives will not be met.  The Manager may exercise broad discretion as to whether and when to sell the Portfolio Investments, and they will have no obligation to sell properties at any particular time.  The Affiliate cannot predict with any certainty the various market conditions affecting real estate investments that will exist at any particular time in the future.  Due to the uncertainty of market conditions that may affect the future disposition of the Portfolio Investments, the Affiliate cannot assure investors that it will be able to sell the Portfolio Investments at a profit in the future.  Accordingly, the extent to which an investor will receive cash distributions and realize potential appreciation on the Portfolio Investments will depend upon fluctuating market conditions.

***If the Affiliate fails to set aside sufficient working capital reserves, the Affiliate may be required to defer necessary property improvements.***

If the Affiliate does not estimate enough reserves for working capital to cover capital improvements throughout the life of each Portfolio Investment, the Affiliate may be required to defer necessary improvements to the property that may cause the property to suffer from a greater risk of obsolescence or a decline in value, or a greater risk of decreased cash flow as a result of fewer potential tenants being attracted to the property.  If this happens, the Affiliate may not be able to maintain projected rental rates for affected properties, and its results of operations may be negatively impacted.

**Risks Associated with Debt Financing**

***The Affiliate may incur mortgage indebtedness and other borrowings, which may increase its business risks.***

The Affiliate expects to finance the acquisition of the Portfolio Investments through mortgage loans and other financing.  In addition, the Affiliate may incur debt to renovate the Portfolio Investments and make distributions to Investors.

Incurring mortgage debt increases the risk of loss since defaults on indebtedness secured by a property may result in foreclosure actions initiated by lenders and the loss of the Affiliate’s property securing the loan that is in default.  For tax purposes, a foreclosure of any of the Portfolio Investments would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage.  If the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds the Affiliate’s tax basis in the property, the Affiliate would recognize taxable income on foreclosure but would not receive any cash proceeds.  If any mortgages contain cross-collateralization or cross-default provisions, there is a risk that more than one real property may be affected by a default.

***Increases in interest rates could increase the amount of the Affiliate’s debt payments and adversely affect its ability to pay distributions to Members.***

The Affiliate expects that in the future it will incur indebtedness that bears interest at fixed or variable rates.  Accordingly, increases in interest rates would increase the Affiliate’s interest costs, which could have a material adverse effect on the Affiliate’s operating cash flow and its ability to pay distributions to Members.  In addition, if the Affiliate needs to repay existing debt during periods of rising interest rates, it could be required to liquidate one or more of its investments in properties at times which may not permit realization of the maximum return on such investments.

***The costs of compliance with environmental laws and other governmental laws and regulations may adversely affect the Affiliate’s income and the cash available for any distributions.***

All real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety.  These laws and regulations generally govern wastewater discharges, air emissions, the operation and removal of underground and above-ground storage tanks, the use, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, and the remediation of contamination associated with disposals.  Some of these laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability on tenants, owners or operators for the costs of investigation or remediation of contaminated properties, regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal.  In addition, the presence of these substances, or the failure to properly remediate these substances, may adversely affect the Affiliate’s ability to sell or rent such property or to use the property as collateral for future borrowing.

Some of these laws and regulations have been amended so as to require compliance with new or more stringent standards as of future dates.  Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws may require material expenditures by us.  The Affiliate cannot assure investors that future laws, ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability, or that the current environmental condition of the Affiliate’s properties will not be affected by the operations of the tenants, by the existing condition of the land, by operations in the vicinity of the properties, such as the presence of underground storage tanks, or by the activities of unrelated third parties.  In addition, there are various local, state and federal fire, health, life-safety and similar regulations that the Affiliate may be required to comply with, and which may subject us to liability in the form of fines or damages for noncompliance.

***Discovery of previously undetected environmentally hazardous conditions may adversely affect the Affiliate’s operating results.***

Under various federal, state, and local environmental laws, ordinances, and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property.  The costs of removal or remediation could be substantial.  Such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances.  Environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures.  Environmental laws provide for sanctions in the event of noncompliance and may be enforced by governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, by private parties.  Certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for release of and exposure to hazardous substances, including asbestos-containing materials into the air, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances.  The Affiliate intends to undertake customary due diligence with respect to potential environmental risks.  Nevertheless, it is still possible that the Affiliate could incur substantial costs for environmental problems, including the cost of defending against claims of liability, of compliance with environmental regulatory requirements, of remediating any contaminated property, or of paying personal injury claims.  These costs could materially adversely affect the Affiliate’s business, assets or results of operations and, consequently, amounts available for distribution to you.

***When the Affiliate sells a Portfolio Investment by providing financing to a purchaser, the Affiliate will bear the risk of default by the purchaser.***

When the Affiliate decides to sell a Portfolio Investment, it intends to use reasonable efforts to sell it for cash.  However, the Affiliate may sell a Portfolio Investment by providing financing to the purchaser.  When the Affiliate provides financing to purchaser, the Affiliate will bear the risk of default by the purchaser and will be subject to remedies provided by law.  There are no limitations or restrictions on the Affiliate’s ability to take purchase money obligations.  The Affiliate may, therefore, take a purchase money obligation secured by a mortgage as part payment for the purchase price.  The terms of payment generally will be affected by custom in the area where the property being sold is located and then-prevailing economic conditions.  If the Affiliate receives promissory notes or other property in lieu of cash from property sales, the distribution of the proceeds of sales to Members, or their reinvestment in other assets, will be delayed until the promissory notes or other property are actually paid, sold, refinanced or otherwise disposed of.

**Operational and Technical Risk Factors Relating to Digital Assets**

Because of the nascency of the Digital Asset sector, there are minimal, if any, well-developed industry standards for security practices or IT infrastructure for Digital Asset wallets and exchanges. Additionally, the ultimate best use for this new technology, if any, remains in doubt. Moreover, ancillary issues facing the sector are not fully resolved, including relating to energy-intensive processes. The many as-yet unanswered or unresolved technologically, economic and ecological issues create substantial investment risks above and beyond those of other more common investments. These risks are heightened by the unclear and potentially changing and challenging regulation and status of many of the Digital Asset markets and their participants in the U.S. and other jurisdictions.

Unlike registered commodity or security exchanges in the traditional financial sector, many of the currently existing exchanges and wallets lack legal protections for their users. Digital Asset wallets function as a substitute for depository institutions but are not banks nor are they covered by the FDIC, an issue of particular importance given historical issues with major exchanges such as Mt. Gox. Moreover, exchanges may not carry the same obligations to customers that a traditional financial institution has. This includes but is not limited to issues regarding privacy, security of assets, and liability for losses. The overall unregulated and often offshore nature of Digital Asset markets creates additional systemic risks for market participants, compared to traditional financial markets. This lack of oversight, regulation, and government support may result in adverse impacts on the value of an investment in the Interests.

The foregoing risks may affect the Reental Master, the Affiliate, and/or the Manager directly or indirectly by negatively impacting user confidence and adoption or commercial viability of Digital Assets and Digital Asset markets, all of which would likely negatively impact the  Reental Master, the Affiliate, and/or the Manager.

**The Immutability of Digital Asset Network Ledgers May Mean Stolen, Lost, or Incorrectly Transferred Digital Assets May Be Irretrievable.** Generally, Digital Assets are controllable only by the possessor of a unique public key and private key relating to the local or online digital wallet in which the Digital Assets are held. While many Blockchains require a public key relating to a digital wallet to be published when used in a spending transaction, private keys must be safeguarded and kept private in order to prevent a third party from accessing the Digital Assets held in such wallet. To the extent a private key is lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised and no backup of the private key is accessible, the  Affiliate will be unable to access the Digital Assets held in the related digital wallet and the private key will not generally be capable of being restored. Any loss of private keys relating to digital wallets used to store the  Affiliate’s Digital Assets could adversely affect an investment in the Interests.

Digital wallets themselves are subject to significant technical risks. Vulnerabilities or errors in the computer code operating digital wallets can, and have in the past, resulted in the permanent loss of Digital Assets held in those wallets. Vulnerabilities and exploits may permit bad actors to irreversibly transfer assets out of the wallet. Similarly, code errors and poorly constructed smart contracts underlying the operation of digital wallets have in the past resulted in the ‘locking’ of wallets, freezing assets in place permanently. This effectively destroys the value of the Digital Assets held in the wallet, and such errors may never be reversible, or the assets rendered irretrievable.

Because anyone with the appropriate key can access and use a Digital Asset, there are significant risks relating to compromised digital security and hacking. There may be existing backdoors, unknown exploits, or bugs in the code underlying the  Affiliate’s Digital Asset wallets. The Manager’s ability to adapt the security systems for the  Affiliate to emerging threats and new technologies will constitute a constant challenge and resource requirement. In the event the  Affiliate’s operating systems, wallets, or other information systems are hacked or compromised, any resulting theft or destruction of keys or related data could adversely affect an investment in the Interests.

**Bad or Malicious Actors Could Attack or Undermine the Immutability and Security of Cryptocurrency Network Ledgers and Protocols.** If a malicious actor or botnet (a volunteer or hacked collection of computers controlled by networked software coordinating the actions of the computers) obtains a majority of the processing power dedicated to mining on certain Digital Asset networks, it may be able to alter the blockchain on which the Digital Asset transaction relies by constructing alternate blocks if it is able to solve for such blocks faster than the remainder of the miners on the Digital Asset network can add valid blocks. In such alternate blocks, the malicious actor or botnet could control, exclude or modify the ordering of transactions, though it could not generate new Digital Assets or transactions using such control. Using alternate blocks, the malicious actor could double spend its own Digital Assets and prevent the confirmation of other users’ transactions for so long as it maintains control. To the extent that such malicious actor or botnet does not yield its majority control of the processing power on various Digital Asset networks, or the Digital Asset community does not reject the fraudulent blocks as malicious, reversing any changes made to the blockchain may not be possible. This risk is particularly acute given the increasing cost of computation and consequent concentration of computing power supporting blockchain network transactions; locations with subsidized energy wield a disproportionate competitive advantage in hashing power, and it is possible that a sufficient percentage of computing power could already be under the effective control of a government actor or private consortium. If so, the risk of such replay attacks and other issues as discussed above may be more significant than generally realized. The ability of such an actor or consortium to unilaterally effect changes on a blockchain network could adversely affect an investment in the Affiliate or the ability of the Affiliate to transact business.

Bad or malicious actors may also orchestrate a fifty-one percent (51%) attack on a given blockchain network, such as the Ethereum network, which would allow the bad actors to gain more than 50% of the network’s mining hash. If these bad actors control the network, they can interrupt the recording of new blocks by preventing other miners of the network from completing and/or recording block transactions. A 51% attack may also allow bad actors to alter or otherwise change any previous transactions, which would have an adverse impact on the  Affiliate and an investment in the Interests. The foregoing risks may affect the  Affiliate directly or indirectly by negatively impacting user confidence and adoption or commercial viability of Digital Assets and Digital Asset markets, all of which would likely negatively impact the  Affiliate.

**There is a Substantial Risk That Developers of New Decentralized Networks Contain Exploitable Errors in Their Underlying Code or Game Theory Assumptions Underpinning Network Functionality.** An exploitable error could precipitate theft, loss of data, or other catastrophic event, potentially impacting the value of an investment in the Interests. Developers may not immediately exploit an error on the code and may wait for a period of substantial appreciation before deploying the exploit. Such an exploit may not be detectable by the Manager, Reental Master, or the Affiliate which could negatively impact the performance of the  Affiliate and/or result in total loss.

**Risks Related to Changes on Blockchain Networks.** Due to the evolving needs of Ethereum and Solana (and other blockchain networks) users, the functionality and operation of the Ethereum, Solana, and other blockchain networks may be subject to change. Such changes may interrupt service or otherwise impede the ongoing maintenance of the platforms and protocols the Manager relies on to execute the  Affiliate’s Investment Strategy. The Manager or its third-party vendors may be unable to quickly adopt new changes, if any, as a result of a change made to the Ethereum or Solana (or other) blockchain networks. As a result, many platforms and protocols may have an unexpected and prolonged period of service disruption, which may delay information or access to Digital Assets held by the Affiliate.

**Digital Wallets Themselves Are Subject to Significant Technical Risks.** Vulnerabilities or errors in the computer code operating digital wallets can, and have in the past, resulted in the permanent loss of tokens held in those wallets. Vulnerabilities and exploits may permit bad actors to irreversibly transfer assets out of the wallet. Similarly, code errors and poorly constructed Smart Contracts underlying the operation of digital wallets have in the past resulted in the ‘locking’ of wallets, freezing assets in place permanently. This effectively destroys the value of the tokens held in the wallet, and such errors may never be reversible, or the assets rendered irretrievable.

T**he** **Affiliate is Dependent on Third-Party Software and Other Services.** The Affiliate’s dependence on functioning software protocols, platforms, and other services. If any third-party software or other service fails, then an investment in the Affiliate may be adversely affected. Despite the Manager’s efforts in ensuring the  Affiliate’s assets are secured, the Manager cannot provide assurance that the  Affiliate’s assets are not subject to the vulnerabilities of the third-party services. A disruption in service or delay in service of a third-party service may result in interruption, delay, or suspension of the  Affiliate’s ability to achieve its investment objective and execute its investment strategies; as a result, the  Affiliate may be negatively impacted.

***Market Risk Factors Relating to Digital Assets***

**Digital Asset Investments are Volatile and Speculative.** To perhaps an even greater degree than traditional venture investments, Digital Assets represent a speculative investment and involve a high degree of risk. As relatively new products and technologies, Digital Assets have not been widely adopted as a means of payment for goods and services by major retail and commercial outlets. The relative lack of acceptance of Digital Assets in the retail and commercial marketplace limits the ability of end-users to pay for goods and services with Digital Assets. A lack of expansion by Digital Assets into retail and commercial markets, or a contraction of such use, may result in increased volatility or fail to temper current volatility. Thus, Digital Assets face similar, if not heightened risks around growth, adoption, and sustainability of business models which characterize early-stage venture investments.

The value of Digital Assets can fluctuate wildly; this is particularly true for the early-stage projects for which initial development or expansion is ongoing, as will be typical with the Affiliate’s Portfolio Investments. The increased value of many Digital Assets is often based on its popularity at a given time which will be influenced by factors such as the number of people buying the asset and the ease with which it can be traded or used. The volatility of Digital Assets may affect the Affiliate directly by, for example, depressing the value of portfolio investments due to investors demanding a premium for volatility-risk, or indirectly by causing the sector to suffer from a lack of use-adoption.

**The Long-Term Market Adoption of Digital Assets is Uncertain.** Demand and liquidity for Digital Assets are heavily dependent upon Digital Asset exchanges. Many of the major exchanges are opaque in their organization and are located in foreign jurisdictions. Many are subject to little or no oversight and provide little transparency on their activities and capitalization. In the past several years, major exchanges have shut down or been forced into bankruptcy by major fraud and incidents of theft. The Affiliate is dependent upon Digital Asset exchanges for the bulk of its activities. To the extent that the marketplace was to lose confidence in the security, legality, or stability of the exchanges, due to this lack of transparency and oversight, it would have an adverse impact on the value of investments by the Affiliate, including in portfolio companies.

Currently, the majority of Digital Assets are held as speculative investments. In order to sustain long term demand and continued growth, there must be widespread adoption of Digital Assets for nonspeculative investment purposes. There are a variety of substantial risk factors which might prevent the widespread adoption of such retail and commercial applications. Should Digital Assets fail to achieve mass adoption by consumers or businesses, they may not achieve long-term sustainable value. To the extent that this leads to a collapse or large-scale exit from Digital Asset markets, this could have an adverse impact on the value of an investment in the Affiliate.

Digital Assets have been the subject of widely reported thefts, hacks, scams, and criminal activity. There is risk that if the consumer public comes to associate Digital Assets with illegality or instability, it may prevent widespread adoption of Digital Assets in any commercial context, with a commensurate potentially adverse impact on the value of an investment in the Affiliate. Digital Assets are a new, untested, global market. It is unclear how those markets will respond to major geopolitical and economic shocks. A mass withdrawal of investors from Digital Asset markets as a consequence of such a shock could crash Digital Asset markets, potentially adversely impacting an investment in the Affiliate.

Other forms of digital currencies and payment systems, such as pre-paid access cards and proprietary smartphone wallets are potential competitors for large-scale adoption of consumer and commercial use of Digital Assets. To the extent that competing digital payment systems preempt or slow the adoption of Digital Asset-based payment systems, the value of an investment in the Affiliate may be adversely impacted.

The foregoing risks may affect the Affiliate directly or indirectly by negatively impacting user confidence and adoption or commercial viability of Digital Assets and Digital Asset markets, all of which would likely negatively impact the Affiliate.

**Technology and Security Concerns Will Be an Ongoing Demand on the Manager’s Attention and Resources.** The Affiliate must adapt to technological change in order to secure and safeguard the Affiliate’s assets. While the Manager believes it has developed an appropriate security system reasonably designed to safeguard the Affiliate’s Digital Assets from theft, loss, destruction, or other issues relating to hackers and technological attack, such assessment is based upon known technology and threats. As technological change occurs, the security threats to the Affiliate’s Digital Assets will likely adapt and previously unknown threats may emerge. Furthermore, the Manager believes that the Affiliate may become a more appealing target of security threats as the size of the Affiliate’s assets grows. To the extent that the Affiliate is unable to identify and mitigate or stop new security threats, the Affiliate’s Digital Assets may be subject to theft, loss, destruction or other attack, which could have a negative impact on the performance of the Affiliate or result in loss of the Affiliate’s assets.

**Failure to Effectively Scale Blockchain Networks Could Permanently Impede the Development and Devalue Digital Assets.** An industry failure to develop technical solutions for scaling blockchain networks in a cost-effective manner could lead to an increase in fee payments for transaction recordation for one or more Digital Assets. This could prompt a movement away from Digital Assets  to alternative method(s) of digital payment and transactional execution. This could reduce both overall demand for the likelihood that Digital Assets achieve widespread commercial and consumer adoption, which might adversely impact the value of the Affiliate.

The nature of blockchain verification generally requires enormous, and exponentially increasing, energy expenditure to provide the competitive computing power needed to solve the cryptographic hash for each sequential block on the chain. Although protocols to reduce or ameliorate this problem are under development, they are early-stage and there is no assurance that any of them will be effective, nor that any effective solution to this problem will ever arise. For example, transaction processing and verification on the Ethereum Blockchain alone currently consumes more energy than the entire nation of Switzerland. Without an effective technical solution, total energy usage necessary to effect transactions on the Ethereum Blockchain alone may exceed the total energy production of the planet within just a few years. Amongst other effects, this could make it literally impossible to transfer or sell some or all of the Affiliate’s Digital Assets, or otherwise render them valueless.

**Intellectual Property Claims Present an Uncertain Risk in Digital Asset Markets.** The Affiliate is unaware of any current claims for intellectual property rights that may prevent the Affiliate from engaging in investments in Digital Assets related to the Affiliate’s anticipated target investment types. However, other parties may assert intellectual property rights in the trade secrets, operations, mechanics, algorithms, or other intellectual property used or developed by the Affiliate or the Affiliate’s Portfolio Investments. Even a meritless claim may incur legal fees and other expenses. Such expenses would negatively affect a portfolio company and the Affiliate. A meritorious claim could threaten the operation or continued existence of the Affiliate. As a result, any intellectual property claim against the Affiliate or a Portfolio Investment could adversely affect investment in the Affiliate.

Additionally, a meritorious intellectual property claim could prevent the Affiliate and other end-users from accessing a Digital Asset network or holding or transferring their Digital Assets, which could force the Affiliate to terminate and liquidate the Affiliate’s Digital Assets (if such liquidation of the Affiliate’s Digital Assets were possible). As a result, an intellectual property claim against the Reental Master, the Affiliate, or the Manager could adversely affect an investment in the Affiliate.

**Lack of Diversification.** Unlike other investment vehicles that are intended to track the overall economy or certain sectors of the US or global economy, the Affiliate’s initial strategy primarily focuses on early-stage projects, companies, and Digital Assets in the blockchain sector. Moreover, the Affiliate’s size may further limit its ability to invest broadly in the blockchain space. As a result, the Affiliate’s portfolio will not be diversified and, if the market for Digital Assets, and other block-chain based products and related investments declines, the Affiliate would likely suffer disproportionate losses compared to the US of global market overall.

***RISKS RELATED TO DIGITAL ASSETS AND THE AFFILIATE’S INVESTMENT STRATEGY***

**Despite Pursuing a Similar Strategy to Traditional Venture Firms, the Affiliate Will Be Significantly Exposed to Digital Asset Markets.** The Affiliate expects to deploy a significant portion, if not the vast majority, of its investment capital in early-stage offerings by high-growth technology companies in the blockchain and Digital Asset sectors. However, in many cases, the true value of these investments lies not with equity rights acquired by the Affiliate (if any), but rights to future Digital Assets to be created or issued by the Affiliate. This means that notwithstanding the apparent similarities between the Affiliate’s activities and a traditional investment strategy, the Affiliate will be significantly more reliant on Digital Asset markets for exit or liquidity opportunity on its investments. **Regulatory Uncertainty in Digital Asset Markets Could Heavily Negatively Impact the Affiliate.** Certain practices common to Digital Asset markets do not appear to have complete regulatory certainty, at a U.S. federal and state level as well as internationally. Changes in law, or changes in the application of existing laws, could negatively impact markets for Digital Assets. In turn, this could reduce returns for the Affiliate or create significant (if not entire investment) losses both directly, by limiting Affiliate investment activities, and secondarily by virtue of an overall decline in the market for Digital Assets. The Affiliate will be highly exposed to these markets and, as a result, would be disproportionately impacted relative to a more diversified investment fund or strategy.

**There Is Substantial Competition for Investment Opportunities.** There is substantial and growing competition for attractive investment opportunities in the Digital Assets sector. Although the Manager believes its experience will attract favorable seed-stage and early start-up stage opportunities, there can be no assurance that the Affiliate will be able to find suitable investments or invest its capital on attractive terms or that any such investments will be successful. This issue may be exacerbated by the fact that this is a newer investment vehicle and may not benefit from the sorts of network effects that other, more established, investment opportunities do. Additionally, although projects incubated through the Manager may present investment opportunities, there is no guarantee the Manager will be able to successfully incubate any projects.

**The Affiliate’s Focus on Early-Stage Ventures Entails Heightened Risks.** The Affiliate and/or Manager may engage persons or potential ventures in their nascent stages or prior to formation of any potential company or identifiable investment as a means of accessing and growing potential deal-flow, “incubating” new companies or gaining access to potential future investments. These activities are speculative and may result in the Affiliate expending assets on activities which may never result in companies, investment opportunities or tangible (or intangible) returns. The risks relating to early-stage companies is heightened and increases the earlier in a company’s (or potential company) lifecycle the Affiliate invests in. As a result, some of the Affiliate and/or the Manager’s efforts or investments of time, effort or capital may never come to fruition or become profitable.

**The Affiliate May Invest In Instruments With Limited Investor Protections.** The lack of consistency and market standards, combined with the ongoing competition for investment opportunities amongst investors in the Digital Assets space, the Affiliate may be forced to invest at substantially worse terms than it would under normal market conditions. In some cases, the instruments in which the Affiliate invests may bear passing similarity to SAFEs or other commonly used venture financing instruments, but provide no equity rights and few, if any, of the protections normally afforded venture investors.

**Valuations in Digital Asset and Private Markets Generally May Be Unsustainable.** Extended negative real interest rates and a glut of global savings has driven historically large inflows into private and alternative investment markets in the last decade, particularly in venture valuations. This phenomenon may be exaggerated in the Digital Asset markets, which has seen large institutional inflows from investors seeking to exploit its reputation for outsize gains. Changing economic conditions, including accelerating inflation and ongoing global supply-chain concerns, may lead central banks to raise interest rates more quickly than the market currently anticipates. This could lead to significant market outflows from the Digital Asset sector and private markets generally, leading to a significant devaluation in the Affiliate’s investments.

**Issues Relating to Insufficiency of Capital or Liquidity May Arise.** The capital needs of Portfolio Investments cannot be accurately determined at the time of the Affiliate’s formation. As a result, no assurance can be given that the Affiliate’s capital will be sufficient to finance the investments planned by the Manager, particularly in light of the Affiliate’s relatively limited anticipated size. In addition, given the limited size of the Affiliate and the fact that it is close-ended, it is likely that the Affiliate will be unable to meet the capital requirements of Portfolio Investments through their entire lifecycle and may, due to the smaller anticipated investments, not get the most beneficial terms in financing rounds with its Portfolio Investments. If Portfolio Investments are not successful in obtaining other sources of capital, their ability to expand and to achieve or maintain a competitive position could be jeopardized. Additionally, if the Affiliate were unable to invest in subsequent “rounds” of investments for its portfolio investments, the Affiliate could be subject to dilution or loss of other investor benefits. Given the illiquidity of the Portfolio Investments and closed-end nature of the Affiliate, the Affiliate may lack the liquidity to invest in opportune investments.

**Investors Must Rely on the Manager.** Investors must rely on the ability of the Manager to identify, evaluate and make investments consistent with the Affiliate’s investment strategy. The Investors, as subscribers to the Affiliate, neither participate in the making of any investment decisions by the Affiliate nor have the opportunity to evaluate personally the relevant economic, financial and other information used by the Manager in its selection, monitoring and disposition of investments. Accordingly, no purchase of Interests should be made unless Investors are willing to entrust all aspects of the management of the Affiliate to the Manager.

**Due to Its Size, The Affiliate May Concentrate a Significant Portion of its Assets in a Limited Number of Digital Assets or Investments.** The Affiliate may concentrate its investments in a single Digital Asset or small group of Digital Assets as part of its investment strategy and, initially, willemphasize investments relating to the Affiliate. A relatively high concentration of investments will reduce the diversification of the Affiliate’s portfolio. The Affiliate’s performance may be more volatile due to the impact of the changes in value of the single or small group of Digital Assets. Unlike some other venture financing investment opportunities, the Affiliate is not subject to applicable securities laws that require it to diversify portfolio holdings. As a result, if the value of the Digital Asset the Affiliate is invested in significantly decreases,the Affiliate’s performance will result in significant losses. Moreover, the Affiliate may incur substantial losses even when Digital Assets, as a sector, perform well.

**The Ethereum Network and Other Blockchains May Experience Delays Due to Network Clogging.** The Ethereum may experience periods of high network traffic, causing transactions to be delayed, suspended, or may result in other similar errors. If the Ethereum network also faces high network traffic, the cost to transact over the network may increase. This could create increased costs for the Affiliate or could negatively impact adoption or growth of Digital Assets, including those the Affiliate may invest in the Manager.

**DAO & DECENTRALIZED FINANCE RISK FACTORS**

Subject to regulatory approvals, the Affiliate may engage in active participation opportunities, including “Yield Farming” or “Liquidity Mining”. Specifically, although this will not be the main focus or investment strategy for the Affiliate, the Affiliate may lend and/or provide liquidity for Digital Assets on DeFi protocols and earned fixed or variable interest and the opportunity to gain additional stakes in an early-stage project, in addition to potential price appreciation of the Digital Assets held in the Smart Contract.

“DAOs” are “decentralized autonomous organizations”. DAOs typically are either entities or informal (i.e., not LLCs or corporations) organizations that do not have the sort of central leadership typical of an ordinary corporation. These organizations are often governed by a specific set of rules enforced on a blockchain and/or maybe managed by their members. DAOs can have numerous varieties and purposes.

“Yield Farming” is the act of leveraging DeFi protocols and products to generate high rates of return, including locking collateral in a Smart Contract and earning capital appreciation by holding the Digital Assets in a locked Smart Contract and earning interest on the Digital Assets held as collateral. In most cases, Yield Farming involves participants contributing to a pool of Digital Assets to hold in a Smart Contract as collateral to produce a return or reward. These activities are often crucial for the functionality of a protocol, and these projects often depend upon early-stage investors (such as the Affiliate) to act in a supporting role to the project ecosystem by lending or staking certain Digital Assets through a DeFi mechanism. In many cases, the rewards for these activities are paid in the form of “Governance Tokens” – Digital Assets which entitle the holder to voting and management rights in the underlying project comparable to those traditionally held by venture investors.

“Smart Contract(s)” are transaction protocols that are programmed to automatically execute, control, or document relevant events and actions according to the terms of the Smart Contract. The Reental Master will primarily engage in transactions involving Smart Contracts run on top of the Ethereum blockchain network.

“Decentralized Finance” or “DeFi” is an ecosystem of decentralized applications enabling participants to access a variety of financial products and/or services including, without limitation, Digital Asset exchanges, margin accounts and trading, Digital Asset derivative products, synthetic assets, algorithmic trading, and lending markets.

**Yield Farming Risks Generally.** The Affiliate may gain the opportunity to act as an early participant in various Yield Farming opportunities, particularly (but not exclusively) relating to products launched by its Portfolio Investments. These opportunities may be highly lucrative but carry a variety of risks which are often heightened for such early participants. These include significant technical and game theoretical risks which could result in a total loss of capital deployed in the opportunity. Similarly, many Yield Farming opportunities are dependent upon third-party pricing sources (“Oracles”) which may be vulnerable to manipulation or exploitation. The Digital Assets used as collateral in Yield Farming are highly volatile. Any given pool may be materially impacted by a significant decrease in value of the underlying asset(s), thereby significantly impacting the profitability of the Affiliate.

**Protocol Governance Risk.** Many of the DeFi platforms the Affiliate expects to utilize or DAOs that the Affiliate anticipates participating in are governed by the participants through the use of “Governance Tokens.” Governance tokens confer the ability to influence decisions concerning the core protocol itself, fees, reward payout, lockup period, and other platform wide decisions.  Affiliate profitability can be materially impacted by the implementation of governance decisions that are not favorable to Reental Master operations.

**DAOs are Novel Structures and May Entail Atypical or Unforeseen Risks, Particularly Where the DAO Lacks a Formal Legal Structure. Digital Assets received for participation in a DAO may have unclear regulatory treatment, notably the application of securities and corporate law.** For example, a DAO without a legal entity associated with it could risk being characterized as a “general partnership” for liability purposes. If the Affiliate were found to be a partner in a DAO determined to be a general partnership, it could potentially carry unlimited, direct personal liability to all debt and legal actions taken against the partnership.

**DeFi Activities May Entail Regulatory Risks.** Because DeFi is a novel financial instrument and has developed and evolved at a rapid pace, it is currently unclear whether a number of regulatory frameworks apply to these DeFi protocols. DeFi protocols are generally non-custodial because the protocol does not have direct access to users; however, regulators may categorize the Smart Contracts as custodians of the Digital Assets held, subjecting these protocols to the dominion of the SEC, CFTC, or other regulatory agency of any jurisdiction. DeFi protocols also generally transcend territorial jurisdictions making it difficult for participants to understand what jurisdiction’s laws, rules, and regulations apply. Additionally, many DeFi protocols mint and distribute tokens that the SEC or other applicable regulatory agency may deem as a security and subject the DeFi protocol and the Affiliate to the applicable securities laws and regulations. In some cases, the underlying Digital Assets may also be determined to be a commodity by the CFTC under the Commodity Exchange Act. If the Digital Assets are commodities, the DeFi protocols and the Affiliate may be subject to applicable laws and regulations relating to the CEA and the CFTC. The DeFi protocols that the Affiliate participates in may also be subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, of which the DeFi protocol may not comply. If the DeFi protocols do not comply with the applicable laws and regulations, the Affiliate’s participation in these Yield Farming pools may be harmed, including a total loss of investment. If the underlying assets in yield farming are determined to be securities, the Affiliate could be found to be an underwriter or a broker or dealer for an unregistered offering and incur substantial liability under securities law. DeFi protocols, by their nature, require collective action by participants. Collective action may arguably make the participants general partners in the venture, subjecting the participants (including potentially the Affiliate) to liability of other participants’ actions. Additionally, the passage of new laws or regulatory rulemaking may inhibit the growth of the web3 space. Proposed regulatory rulemaking both in the United States and in the European Union may produce legal and practical challenges for novel activities that may be critical to the development of web3 protocols, such as automated market making, proprietary liquidity provision and “know-your-customer” requirements.

**DeFi Litigation Risks.** There appears to be a growing trend towards attempts to hold investors and other traditionally unaffiliated parties liable in litigation actions brought against companies in the Digital Assets space. For example, in the *Daniel Ocampo v. DFinity Labs* class action, the plaintiffs have alleged primary liability against the major investors in the token issuer for securities fraud. Similar theories have been advanced in other recent class action claims. This risk is heightened in the context of investors which, like the Affiliate, take an active role in the DeFi products and activities of its Portfolio Investments. Any such lawsuit against the Affiliate or Manager alleging such a theory could materially impact the Affiliate’s performance. In addition to risking a money judgement, even a successful defense would incur significant legal costs and serve to take time away from the Manager’s efforts to source deal flow and effectively deploy the Affiliate’s capital.

# **BUSINESS**

**Introduction**

The Affiliate has been formed for the purpose of generating capital appreciation and current income through the acquisition of income producing properties located in the United States. The Manager will select the Portfolio Investments.

**Selection of Portfolio Investments**

The Manager and its principals have substantial experience in managing and operating short-term rental properties across various United States markets.

The Manager and its principals intend to identify the Portfolio Investments to be purchased by the Affiliate, based on the same criteria and due diligence that they utilize in their other real estate investments.  The Affiliate will purchase a property that currently generates income through rental payments from tenants.

The investment strategy has the key elements:

- risk minimization by acquiring a property with stable income stream from tenants.

- the selection of a property through a careful analysis and due diligence, and the related leases, tenants and the area in which the property is located.

- opportunistic sale of each property.

**Sale of Properties**

The Manager's investment strategy is based on an opportunistic property sale.  The Manager has structured the Affiliate to maximize the Affiliate’s ability to complete such sales on attractive terms.  The Manager believes that both long and medium-term holding periods offer good profit potential for the Affiliate.

**Financing**

The Affiliate intends to obtain loans from financial institutions and other third-party lenders to finance the acquisition value of the Portfolio Investments.

The Affiliate will also have the right to obtain third party loans to finance improvements and renovations to its properties and to make distributions to investors.

The Affiliate will be authorized to obtain loans secured by liens on the Affiliate's property, provided that such loans do not exceed 50% of the estimated aggregate fair market value of the Affiliate’s assets at the time of the loans are funded.

**Property Management and Leasing Services**

The Affiliate will retain, when appropriate, a specialized management company to manage the Affiliate’s property, which may be related to the Manager or the principals. In addition, the Affiliate may also retain leasing agents, agents to market and lease properties on behalf of the Affiliate, which may be related to the Manager or the principals. All fees paid towards property management and leasing services shall be borne by the Affiliate.

**Insurance**

The Affiliate shall seek to obtain insurance when available, practical, and economical, to cover damages resulting from fire, theft, and to protect the Affiliate from certain liabilities.

**Potential Portfolio Investments**

As of the date of this memorandum, the Manager has not identified any Portfolio Investments which meets the Affiliate’s criteria.

**Other Activities of the Manager and Related Persons**

The Manager and its principals and their Affiliates are engaged in various business activities other than the Affiliate’s business and expect to continue to be so engaged, although they intend to devote such time and effort to the business of the Affiliate as they may consider necessary or appropriate.  Any of these persons may continue, or initiate further, such activities, whether or not such activities compete with the business of the Affiliate.

Ability to Engage in Other Activities.  The Manager and each other Related Person may engage independently or with others, for its or their own accounts and for the accounts of others, in other business ventures and activities of every nature and description whether such ventures are competitive with the business of the Affiliate or otherwise, including, without limitation, purchasing, selling, lease or otherwise holding Portfolio Investments for the account of any other Person or enterprise or for its or his own account. Neither the Affiliate nor any Members shall have any rights or obligations by virtue of the Operating Agreement in and to such independent ventures and activities or the income or profits derived therefrom.

Engagement of Other Persons. The Manager may, from time to time, employ any Person or engage third parties to render services to the Affiliate on such terms and for such compensation as the Manager may determine in its sole discretion, including, without limitation, attorneys, brokers or finders, and independent auditors. Such employees and third parties may be Affiliates of the Manager or of one or more of the Members. Persons retained, engaged, or employed by the Affiliate may also be engaged, retained or employed by and act on behalf of the Manager, one or more Members or any of their respective Affiliates.

Contract Restrictions. The Manager may cause the Affiliate to enter into contracts and transactions with the Manager and any Person that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the Manager, provided that the terms of any such contract or transaction are fair and reasonable to the Affiliate and are not less favorable than could be obtained in arms-length negotiations with unrelated third parties for similar services.

**Conflicts of Interest**

While the Manager intends to avoid situations involving conflicts of interest, there may be situations in which the Tokens of the Affiliate may conflict with the Tokens of the Reental Master, the Manager, and/or any Member.  Under the terms of the Operating Agreement, the activities of the Manager and any other Related Person that are specifically authorized by the terms of the Operating Agreement will not be deemed a breach of the Operating Agreement or any duty owed by such Person to the Affiliate or to any Member.

**Indemnification of the Manager and its Affiliates**

The Affiliate is obligated to indemnify and hold harmless all the Manager and all Related Persons, from and against any and all damages, which, in the judgment of the Manager, arise out of, relate to or are in connection with the Operating Agreement or the management or conduct of the business or affairs of the Affiliate, or any other Person in which the Affiliate has a direct or indirect interest, except for any such Damages that are finally found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted primarily from the bad faith, gross negligence or intentional misconduct of, or breach of the Affiliate or knowing violation of law by, the Person seeking indemnification. The Members must pay the attorneys’ fees and expenses as they are incurred upon receipt of an undertaking from the Related Person to repay such amounts if it is ultimately determined that such Related Person is not entitled to indemnification.

# **COMPENSATION OF MANAGER AND AFFILIATES**

The following table summarizes the types and estimated amounts of compensation, fees, profits, distributions, and other benefits (including reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses) which the Manager and its affiliates may earn or receive in connection with the offering or the operation of the Affiliate.

The fees have been determined by the Manager and were not determined by arm’s-length negotiations.  They may exceed charges which would be charged by an outside third party for the same services.

|**Entity Receiving Compensation**|**Type of Compensation**|
| - | - |
| Manager | The Manager may be entitled to a Management Fee (the “Management Fee”), payable monthly, ranging between zero percent (0%) and two percent (2%) of Net Operating Cash Flow for any such Portfolio Investment, as defined in an Affiliate offering. |
| Manager | The Manager will be entitled to a Success Fee, payable at the time of a Liquidity Event, ranging between thirty percent (30%) and forty percent (40%) of the Net Gains from a Liquidity Event, less any costs associated with effectuating such Liquidity Event, as set forth in an Affiliate offering. Net Gains shall refer to the generally accepted accounting principle of net capital gains, as calculated at the time of sale of each real property. |
| Manager | The Manager shall be entitled to a Tokenization Process & Platform Fee, which refers to an entry and setup fee of ten percent (10%) of the total investments or Tokens sold by each Affiliate, that the Manager collects at the close of each subscription in consideration of all the costs incurred in preparing and launching an Affiliate offering. |
| Manager or Third-Party Provider | The Manager may cause the Affiliate to enter into contracts and transactions with the Manager and any Person that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the Manager, provided that the terms of any such contract or transaction are fair and reasonable to the Affiliate and are not less favorable than could be obtained in arms-length negotiations with unrelated third parties for similar services. |
| Manager | The Affiliate will reimburse the Manager for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by it in connection with the business of the Affiliate. |
| Parent, Affiliate or Subsidiary of the Manager | A parent, subsidiary or affiliate entity of the Manager may acquire Tokens. They will be entitled to receive distributions as a result of their Capital Contributions on the same basis as other Members. The Affiliates of the Manager who acquire Tokens may not be required to pay the same Management Fee(s) as the other Members. |
| Manager | The Manager will earn interest on any loans which they may make to the Affiliate. |

# **SUITABILITY STANDARDS**

Prospective investors should satisfy themselves that an investment in the Tokens is suitable for them, should examine this memorandum, and should avail themselves of access to such additional information about the offering, the Affiliate, the Manager and its business as they consider necessary to make an informed investment decision.

Each investor must also, either alone or together with a purchaser representative, have sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters generally and in securities investment in particular to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of investing in the Affiliate.

**Investors that are subject to income tax should be aware that investment in the Affiliate may (if the Affiliate is successful) result in taxable income or tax liabilities in excess of cash distributions available to pay such liabilities. Accordingly, Tokens may not be a suitable investment for prospective investors who will be subject to and do not desire such consequences.**

**Stricter State Standards**

Residents of certain states may be subject to stricter suitability standards than those stated above and the Manager may reject the Subscription Agreements of prospective investors not meeting such standards.

**Reliance on Subscriber Information**

Representations and requests for information regarding the satisfaction of investor suitability standards are included in the Subscription Agreement that each prospective investor must complete.  The Tokens have not been registered under the Securities Act and are being offered in reliance on Section 4(2) thereof and Regulation D promulgated by the SEC thereunder, and in reliance on applicable exemptions from state law registration or qualification provisions. Accordingly, prior to selling Tokens to any investor, the Manager intends to make all inquiries reasonably necessary to satisfy itself that the prerequisites of such exemptions have been met.  Prospective investors will also be required to provide whatever additional evidence is deemed necessary by the Manager to substantiate information or representations contained in their Subscription Agreements.  The standards set forth above are only minimum standards.  The Manager reserves the right, in its exclusive discretion, to reject subscriptions for any reason, regardless of whether a prospective investor meets the suitability standards.  In addition, the Manager reserves the right, in its exclusive discretion, to waive minimum suitability standards not imposed by law.

The Manager anticipates imposing comparable suitability standards in connection with any resale of Tokens.

# **FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**General**

The Affiliate is not intended to be a so-called “tax-shelter.”  No substantial tax benefits are expected to be derived from an investment in the Affiliate.  Moreover, because net profits may be realized by the Affiliate during a tax year without a distribution to the Members in that year, Members may be allocated taxable income in excess of distributions.  See also “Risk Factors — Risks Related to the Offering.”

Summarized below are the material Federal income tax principles applicable to the Affiliate, based on the Code, the Treasury Regulations and published rulings and court decisions currently in effect.  No assurance can be given that future legislative or administrative changes or court decisions will not significantly modify the law and render inapplicable or incorrect the statements and opinions expressed herein.  Any such changes may or may not be retroactive with respect to transactions completed prior to the effective date of such changes.  The applicable Treasury Regulations and interpretations dealing with this area of taxation are under continuing review by the IRS, and changes in such Treasury Regulations or interpretations could adversely affect the Affiliate and the Members.

Tax effects on Members of federal income tax laws may not be the same as those of state or local income tax laws.  EACH PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR SHOULD CONFER WITH ITS PERSONAL TAX ADVISERS REGARDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF PORTFOLIO PRODUCT IN THE REENTAL MASTER.  THE MANAGER ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THIS TRANSACTION TO ANY INVESTOR.

**Federal Income Tax Treatment**

Under the provisions of the Code and Treasury Regulations as in effect on date of this memorandum, as well as under the decisional law interpreting the Code and the Treasury Regulations, the Affiliate should be classified for federal income tax purposes as a “Limited Liability Company,” that could be taxed either as a disregarded entity, partnership or corporation

It is the own and sole responsibility of each Member to assess the tax consequences of an
ownership or transfer of a Token or the potential buyback of a Token by the Affiliate and to pay any and all taxes resulting from such ownership, transfer or a potential buyback of the Token(s) by the Affiliate(s).
Prospective purchasers are advised to consult with their own tax advisers concerning the comprehensive tax consequences of their ownership of Tokens. No information provided in this memorandum and/or on Rental Master’s website constitutes tax advice which could lead to any form of responsibility or liability by the Affiliate by any means.

**Dividend Policy**

The Affiliate is organized so as to permit any distributions it might make to be made without being taxed as dividends. The Affiliate will never declare or pay cash dividends. The Affiliate intends to retain earnings, if any, to support the development of the business and therefore, does not anticipate paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Payment of future dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of the Manager after taking into account various factors, including current financial condition, operating results and current and anticipated cash needs.


**Member’s Tax Basis in Tokens**

Generally, the initial tax basis of a Member’s Interest will equal the amount of money contributed to the Affiliate.  Basis is reduced (but not below zero) by the Member’s share of Affiliate distributions and losses.  Basis is increased by the Member’s share of the Affiliate’s income and additional contributions to capital. The Member may, subject to other limitations, deduct his or her share of Affiliate losses only to the extent that such losses do not exceed his or her adjusted basis in the Interest.  Losses in excess of basis may be carried over until basis is increased above zero.

**Dissolution and Liquidation of the Affiliate**

On dissolution of the Affiliate, any remaining assets of the Affiliate may be sold, which may result in the realization of taxable gain of such gain to the Affiliate.  Distributions of cash or Affiliate assets in complete liquidation of the Affiliate will generally be treated first as a return of capital and thereafter as a capital gain, to the extent of the amount of cash distributed. Generally, upon liquidation or termination of the Affiliate, income will be recognized by a Member to the extent that amounts distributed exceed such Member’s adjusted tax basis in his or her Tokens at the time of distribution.

**Foreign Investors**

Investors who are not residents of the United States for federal income tax purposes and foreign entities may have significantly different tax consequences from an investment in the Affiliate than persons who are residents for United States income tax purposes. Accordingly, a foreign person or entity considering investing in the Affiliate should consult with such person’s own tax advisers with respect to the specific tax consequences to such person of such an investment under United States federal, state and local income tax laws, and with respect to the treatment of income and gain from such investment under the tax laws of any foreign jurisdiction in which such person is subject to tax.

**Returns and Tax Information**

The Affiliate will annually furnish to the Members sufficient information from its information return for the Members to prepare their own federal and state income tax returns.  The Affiliate’s information returns will be prepared by independent certified public accountants selected by the Manager.  See “Reports.”

**Audit of Tax Returns**

The IRS may audit the Affiliate’s information returns.  Any such audit may precipitate audits of the income tax returns of Members.  If the IRS successfully asserts a position to adjust any item of income, gain, deduction, or loss reported on a Affiliate information return, corresponding adjustments would be made to the income tax returns of Members. Any such audit might also result in IRS adjustments to a Member’s reported income or loss unrelated to the Affiliate. If a tax deficiency is determined, then the taxpayer is liable for interest on such deficiency from the due date of the return. The interest rate is adjusted quarterly and is generally based on the average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity of 3 years or less.

**Possible Legislative Tax Changes**

The foregoing summary of federal income tax law reflects provisions of recent legislation.  Because, however, Treasury Regulations and other official interpretations have not been issued with respect to a number of such provisions, their meaning is uncertain.  In addition, legislation has been or may be proposed in Congress that might have a substantial and adverse effect on Members.  Investors should consult with their own professional advisers as to all current and possible future proposals with respect to federal, state and local tax legislation and the effect, if any, that such legislation may have on an investment in Tokens.

**The income tax aspects of the Affiliate summarized above are general in nature and are not intended to be a complete explanation of the income tax results of investing in the Affiliate.  Each prospective Member should consult with his or her own tax adviser for detailed information.**

# **TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

The Offering has not been registered or qualified under the securities laws of any jurisdiction anywhere in the world. The RNT Tokens, if issued, are being offered and sold only in jurisdictions where such registration or qualification is not required, including pursuant to applicable exemptions that generally limit the purchasers who are eligible to purchase the RNT Tokens, if issued, and that restrict their resale.

Holders of the RNT Tokens may not offer, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, encumber or otherwise dispose of the RNT Tokens except with the prior consent of the Affiliate. The RNT Tokens may not be offered, sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, encumbered or otherwise disposed of except as permitted under applicable securities laws and the additional restrictions imposed on the RNT Tokens hereunder.

**Notice to Purchasers**

The RNT Tokens, if issued, have not been registered under the Securities Act or any securities laws of any state and, unless so registered, the RNT Tokens may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and such other securities laws. Accordingly, the RNT Tokens are being initially offered and sold only (1) to \"accredited investors\" (as defined under Regulation D), in each case, in reliance on, and in compliance with, the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Rule 506(c) of Regulation D under the Securities Act, and (2) outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance upon other exemptions, such as Regulation S.

**Requisite Opinion of Counsel**

The opinion of counsel referred to in subsection (iv) above will be in form and substance satisfactory to the Manager, shall be from counsel satisfactory to the Manager (which, in the case of an assignee that is an institutional investor, may be staff counsel regularly employed by such institutional investor) and shall be substantially to the effect that (unless specified otherwise by the Manager) the consummation of the Assignment contemplated by the opinion will not:

(i) violate any provisions of the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws;
(ii) require the Manager or the Affiliate to register as an investment fund under the Investment Fund Act and (whether or not such Assignment is of the assigning Member’s entire Interest), that the assignee is a Person that counts as one beneficial owner for purposes of Section 3(c)(1) of the Investment Fund Act;
(iii) cause the Affiliate to be taxable as a corporation or association under the Code;
(iv) violate the laws of any state or the rules and regulations of any Governmental Authority applicable to such Assignment;
(v) pose a material risk that the Affiliate will be treated as a “publicly traded corporation;” and
(vi) cause all or any portion of the assets of the Affiliate to constitute “plan assets” under ERISA or the Code of any Member for the purposes of ERISA.

In giving such opinion, counsel may, with the consent of the Manager, rely as to factual matters on certificates of the assigning Member, the assignee and the Manager.

**Admission of Assignees as Substitute Members**

No assignee of all or any part of an Interest of a Member in the Affiliate will be admitted to the Affiliate as a Substitute Member unless and until the Manager has consented to such substitution in its sole and absolute discretion, and provided that said assignee of the Member has complied with the relevant provisions of the Operating Agreement.  Unless and until an assignee of an Interest becomes a Substitute Member, such assignee shall not be entitled to exercise any vote, consent or any other right or entitlement with respect to such Interest.  In the event of the admission of an assignee as a Substitute Member, all references herein to the assigning Member shall be deemed to apply to such Substitute Member, and such Substitute Member shall succeed to all rights and obligations of the assigning Member hereunder.  A Person shall be deemed admitted to the Affiliate as a Substitute Member at the time that the foregoing provisions are satisfied.  No attempted Assignment and no substitution shall be recognized by the Affiliate unless effected in accordance with and as permitted by this Agreement.

# **REPORTS**

**Annual Financial Information**

Subject to the Manager receiving all necessary information from third parties, within ninety (90) days after the end of each fiscal year of the Affiliate, the Manager will send each Member a statement of their return on investment as of the end of the fiscal year and prepared on the same basis used for the computation of adjustments to Capital Accounts.

# **ACCESS TO INFORMATION**

Prospective investors and their purchaser representatives are invited to contact the Manager to review any written materials or documents relating to the offering or the Affiliate, including any financial information available concerning the Affiliate or the Manager. The Manager will answer all inquiries from prospective investors relative to the offering and will provide additional information (to the extent that the Manager possesses such information or can acquire it without unreasonable effort or expense) necessary to verify the accuracy of any representations or information set forth in this memorandum. Upon joining the Affiliate, Investors shall have access to the Reental Platform which provides various online features such as an online payment portal and information regarding the Portfolio Investment.

The risks associated with the Series are further detailed in the Master Memorandum.

**Other Activities of the Manager and Related Persons**

The Manager and its principals and their Companys are engaged in various business activities other than the Company’s business and expect to continue to be so engaged, although they intend to devote such time and effort to the business of the Company as they may consider necessary or appropriate.  Any of these people may continue, or initiate further, such activities, whether or not such activities compete with the business of the Company.

**Ability to Engage in Other Activities**

The Manager and each other Related Person may engage independently or with others, for its or their own accounts and for the accounts of others, in other business ventures and activities of every nature and description whether such ventures are competitive with the business of the Company or otherwise, including, without limitation, purchasing, selling, lease or otherwise holding Portfolio Investments for the account of any other Person or enterprise or for its or his own account. Neither the Company nor any Members shall have any rights or obligations by virtue of the Operating Agreement in and to such independent ventures and activities or the income or profits derived therefrom.

While the Manager intends to avoid situations involving conflicts of interest, there may be situations in which the Tokens of the Company may conflict with the Tokens of the Reental Master, the Manager, and/or any Member.  Under the terms of the Operating Agreement, the activities of the Manager and any other Related Person that are specifically authorized by the terms of the Operating Agreement will not be deemed a breach of the Operating Agreement or any duty owed by such Person to the Company or to any Member.

**Indemnification of the Manager and its Companies**

The Company is obligated to indemnify and hold harmless all the Manager and all Related Persons, from and against any and all damages, which, in the judgment of the Manager, arise out of, relate to or are in connection with the Operating Agreement or the management or conduct of the business or affairs of the Company, or any other Person in which the Company has a direct or indirect interest, except for any such Damages that are finally found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted primarily from the bad faith, gross negligence or intentional misconduct of, or breach of the Company or knowing violation of law by, the Person seeking indemnification. The Members must pay the attorneys’ fees and expenses as they are incurred upon receipt of an undertaking from the Related Person to repay such amounts if it is ultimately determined that such Related Person is not entitled to indemnification.

### **SUITABILITY STANDARDS**

Prospective investors should satisfy themselves that an investment in the Tokens is suitable for them, should examine this memorandum, and should avail themselves of access to such additional information about the offering, the Company, the Manager, and its business as they consider necessary to make an informed investment decision.

Each investor must also, either alone or together with a purchaser representative, have sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters generally and in securities investment in particular to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of investing in the Company.

**Investors that are subject to income tax should be aware that investment in the Company may (if the Company is successful) result in taxable income or tax liabilities in excess of cash distributions available to pay such liabilities. Accordingly, Tokens may not be a suitable investment for prospective investors who will be subject to and do not desire such consequences.**

**Stricter State Standards**

Residents of certain states may be subject to stricter suitability standards than those stated above and the Manager may reject the Subscription Agreements of prospective investors not meeting such standards.

**Reliance on Subscriber Information**

Representations and requests for information regarding the satisfaction of investor suitability standards are included in the Subscription Agreement that each prospective investor must complete.  The Tokens have not been registered under the Securities Act and are being offered in reliance on Section 4(2) thereof and Regulation D promulgated by the SEC thereunder, and in reliance on applicable exemptions from state law registration or qualification provisions. Accordingly, prior to selling Tokens to any investor, the Manager intends to make all inquiries reasonably necessary to satisfy itself that the prerequisites of such exemptions have been met.  Prospective investors will also be required to provide whatever additional evidence is deemed necessary by the Manager to substantiate information or representations contained in their Subscription Agreements.  The standards set forth above are only minimum standards.  The Manager reserves the right, in its exclusive discretion, to reject subscriptions for any reason, regardless of whether a prospective investor meets the suitability standards.  In addition, the Manager reserves the right, in its exclusive discretion, to waive minimum suitability standards not imposed by law. **The Manager anticipates imposing comparable suitability standards in connection with any resale of Tokens**.

### **TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

The Offering has not been registered or qualified under the securities laws of any jurisdiction anywhere in the world. The RNT Tokens, if issued, are being offered and sold only in jurisdictions where such registration or qualification is not required, including pursuant to applicable exemptions that generally limit the purchasers who are eligible to purchase the RNT Tokens, if issued, and that restrict their resale.

Holders of the RNT Tokens may not offer, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, encumber or otherwise dispose of the RNT Tokens except with the prior consent of the Company. The RNT Tokens may not be offered, sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, encumbered or otherwise disposed of except as permitted under applicable securities laws and the additional restrictions imposed on the RNT Tokens hereunder.

**Notice to Purchasers**

The RNT Tokens, if issued, have not been registered under the Securities Act or any securities laws of any state and, unless so registered, the RNT Tokens may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and such other securities laws.

### **FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**The Series is not intended to be a so-called “tax-shelter.”  No substantial tax benefits are expected to be derived from an investment in the Series.  Moreover, because net profits may be realized by the Series during a tax year without a distribution to the Members in that year, Members may be allocated taxable income in excess of distributions. See Master Memorandum “Federal Income Tax Considerations”**

The material Federal income tax principles applicable to the Company, based on the Code, the Treasury Regulations and published rulings and court decisions currently in effect are summarized in detail in the Master Memorandum. You are advised to review the Master Memorandum, and specifically the Tax Considerations detailed therein before making any investment in Series #.  No assurance can be given that future legislative or administrative changes or court decisions will not significantly modify the law and render inapplicable or incorrect the statements and opinions expressed herein or in the Master Memorandum.  Any such changes may or may not be retroactive with respect to transactions completed prior to the effective date of such changes.  The applicable Treasury Regulations and interpretations dealing with this area of taxation are under continuing review by the IRS, and changes in such Treasury Regulations or interpretations could adversely affect the Company and the Members.

**EACH PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR SHOULD CONFER WITH ITS PERSONAL TAX ADVISERS REGARDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS. THE MANAGER ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THIS TRANSACTION TO ANY INVESTOR.**

The Investor acknowledges that any financial information that the Company has provided to the Investor is based on projections or other estimates and is not based on historical financial information and is inherently unreliable and is not serving as a basis for the Investor to acquire the Tokens or confirm its investment decision.

3.5. **Certain Risk Factors**.

3.5.1. Investor recognizes that an investment in the Company and the purchase of the Tokens involves numerous risks and Investor has taken full cognizance of and understands all of the risks related to the purchase of the Tokens.  No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful, that the objectives of the Company will be attainable, in whole or in part, or that the Company's business model will be successfully achieved.

3.5.2. Investor recognizes that the Tokens issued and offered to the public under this Private Sale are a novel and complex financial instrument. The Issuer is a recently incorporated company with only minimum capital and no financial track record. The technology used for the issuance of the Tokens is not fully tested and the markets for trading with the Tokens, if available at all, are very immature. Investors understand there is no guarantee that they will receive interest payments and full repayment upon maturity. Under adverse circumstances they will receive less than the subscription price or suffer a complete loss of the invested capital.

An investment in Tokens is suitable only for experienced and financially sophisticated investors who are in a position to evaluate the risks, including the risks related to the Tokens and the underlying technology, and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses, including a complete loss, which may result from such investment. Before subscribing to or otherwise acquiring any Tokens, prospective investors should specifically ensure that they understand the structure of, and the risk inherent to, the Tokens and should specifically consider the risk facts set out under the section \"Risk Factors” in the Private Placement Memorandum.

3.6. **Tax Consequences**. Investor acknowledges that there are significant tax risks associated with the acquisition, holding and disposition of the Tokens.  In addition, federal, state and local tax laws and rules relating to corporations are complex and are subject to change or modification at any time, either prospectively or retroactively through the continuous evolution of judicial decisions and administrative interpretations and/or the enactment of new legislation.  No representation is hereby given as to the tax consequences of the investment in the Tokens to Investor.  INVESTOR ACKNOWLEDGES THAT PRIOR TO INVESTING, THE COMPANY HAS RECOMMENDED THAT INVESTOR SEEK TAX ADVICE WITH RESPECT TO THE PURCHASE OF THE TOKENS.

3.7. **Documents Not Complete; Private Placement Memorandum Prepared**.  The Investor acknowledges that it has received a copy and has had sufficient opportunity to review the Confidential Qualifying Private Placement Memorandum of Rental Master, LLC and the Confidential Private Placement Memorandum of Issuer, dated \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, and fully understands the disclosures therein.
